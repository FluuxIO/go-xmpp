# xmpp_component

This component will connect to ejabberd and act as a subdomain "service" of your primary XMPP domain
(in that case localhost).

This component does nothing expect connect and show up in service discovery.

To be able to connect this component, you need to add a listener to your XMPP server.

Here is an example ejabberd configuration for that component listener:

```yaml
listen:
...
  -
    port: 8888
    module: ejabberd_service
    password: "mypass"
```

ejabberd will listen for a component (service) on port 8888 and allows it to connect using the
secret "mypass".
